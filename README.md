### What I learned

By working on this project, I have enhanced my skills in website design by creating visually appealing and functional designs based on provided requirements and style guides. I have successfully translated these designs, created using Figma, into a fully functional React application that prioritizes the user experience and follows UI/UX design principles.

One notable aspect of this project was my introduction to Tailwind CSS. It was a delightful experience as it significantly sped up the styling process and offered convenient utilities for styling elements. The responsive table, which dynamically adjusts based on the number of seats selected by the user, is a highlight of my website. It provides a seamless user experience and adapts to user input in real time. Additionally, the form element intelligently checks the availability of the selected table at the specified date and time.

Furthermore, I integrated animations using Framer Motion, which simplified the process and allowed me to create engaging and smooth animations throughout the application. These animations enhance the overall user experience and bring elements to life.

Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience, improving my proficiency in web design, frontend development with React, and the utilization of modern tools and libraries like Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
### Continued development

In future work, I am aiming to improve my animation skills to make my websites more lively and fun, and also aim to improve my code clarity.
