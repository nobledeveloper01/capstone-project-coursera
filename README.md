- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

By doing this project, i improved my skills in create designs of websites using provided requirements and style guides, and then translating those deisngs that were made by figma into working React application that elevates the experience while taking Ui/Ux deisng prenciples into consideration. It was my first experience with Tailwind css which was pleasent, it made styling elements much faster and more convinent. Also, a peace of my website i would love to highlight is the responsive table that shows when a user selects the number of seats needed, which dynamicly changes depending on user input, and form element that mounts if the table entered is avaible at the time and date selected or not. Lastely, animations where created with Framer Motion which made the process straight forward and simple.

### Continued development

In the future works, im aiming to improve my animation skills to make my websites more lively and fun, and also aiming to improve my code clarity.
